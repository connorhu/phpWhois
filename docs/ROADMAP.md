Development roadmap
===================

General ideas
-------------

- Add support for binding source ip
- Add functionality for comparing responses (Serializing Response object?)

Optional features
-----------------
Maybe there should be additional methods implemented like `getDaysToExpire` 
which will be reporting a number of days left to domain expiration if possible.
